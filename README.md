# MyStudio 

MyStudio is a assignment management app for private music studios. At the end of a one-on-one lesson with a teacher, a student typically receives an assignment for their next lesson. MyStudio allows the teacher to store all previous lessons assignments for each student, and keep them separate by student, which is helpful for teachers with large studios. For the student it allows them a location to reference their lesson notes as to avoid losing or "forgetting" their assignment.
